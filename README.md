# Manual-Testing-project
My software testing project aims to ensure the robustness, reliability, and performance of the software application (opencart.com). As technology evolves, maintaining a high-quality software product is crucial to meet user expectations and industry standards. This project focuses on systematically testing various aspects  of the application to identify and rectify potential issues before the product is released to end-users.
